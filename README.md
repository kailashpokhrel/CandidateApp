# CandidateApp

CandidateApp

Overview
The CandidateApp is a web application designed to manage and track candidate information. It supports storing, retrieving and updating candidate data, with the potential for future scalability to handle dozens of thousands of records. The app is designed with a focus on modularity, performance, and future extensibility. It is built with .NET 8.0 and Docker for containerization.

**Technologies Used**
.NET 8.0 for building the application
Docker for containerization and deployment
SQL Server for the relational database
Entity Framework Core for ORM and database migrations


**How to Run the Application**

Pre-requisites:
Docker must be installed on your system. If you don't have Docker, install it from Docker's official website.
.NET 8 SDK (if you plan to build locally).

Steps to Run:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/kailashpokhrel/CandidateApp.git

cd CandidateApp
2. Build and run the application using Docker Compose:

docker-compose build
docker-compose up

3. Once the containers are up, the Candidate API will be accessible at 
http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html

Docker Setup:
The application uses Docker for containerization. The docker-compose.yml file sets up the following services:
Web Service: The API application (Candidate.API).
Database Service: A SQL Server container to store candidate data.

Database:
The database used is SQL Server and is managed using Entity Framework Core for migrations. If you are running locally, the database connection string is configured in the docker-compose.yml file.


**Design Decisions**

Repository Pattern:
Data access is abstracted through the Repository Pattern, which decouples the application logic from the database. This makes it easier to swap out database providers in the future (e.g., switching from SQL Server to PostgreSQL or NoSQL databases).

Asynchronous Operations:
All database calls and external service calls are asynchronous, improving the application's scalability and responsiveness.

Modular Architecture:
Refactor the application into a microservices architecture to make the system more modular and scalable, especially as the app grows and additional features are added.


**Key Assumptions Made**

Scalability: Assumed the application will need to scale to handle large volumes of candidates and job applications in the future, requiring optimized database access and caching strategies.

Database Flexibility: Assumed the potential for migration to other database systems (NoSQL, NewSQL) without major changes to the core business logic.

Separation of Concerns: Assumed clear separation of concerns in the architecture to maintain maintainability and extensibility, particularly in terms of the application’s API, domain models, and infrastructure.

Microservices Evolution: Assumed the application may evolve into a microservices architecture as business requirements grow, with services being modular and independently deployable.

Performance Optimization: Assumed optimization for high performance, using caching strategies, asynchronous processing, and leveraging a distributed message queue for background tasks.

Testing Strategy: Assumed thorough unit and integration tests to ensure the stability of the application, with continuous integration for automatic builds and deployment.

Cloud-Native Design: Assumed the application would eventually need to be deployed on cloud infrastructure, leveraging Kubernetes for auto-scaling and container orchestration.

Logging & Monitoring: Assumed robust logging and monitoring mechanisms, utilizing Elasticsearch and Grafana/Prometheus for detailed observability and proactive issue detection.

Extensibility: Assumed the application is designed to be easily extendable, with clear interfaces for new features, integrations, and future enhancements without significant refactoring.


**Future Extensibility & Improvement **

Database Abstraction: If you need to switch to another database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB), you only need to modify the ApplicationDbContext and CandidateRepository implementation without affecting the business logic layer.

Scalability: The code is modular, so it can be horizontally scaled by using distributed caching (e.g., Redis) for handling a large number of requests and maintaining state between services.

Caching: We use IMemoryCache for local caching. For a more scalable approach in production, consider Redis or other distributed cache providers to support scaling across multiple instances.Implement caching for frequently accessed data using tools like Redis to reduce database load and improve response times for common queries (e.g., retrieving candidate profiles).


CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):
We’ve separated the read and write logic to improve scalability and performance. Commands are responsible for updating the data, while queries are responsible for fetching data. This design helps in optimizing both operations independently.

Mediator Pattern:
We’ve used MediatorR to handle communication between different components of the application, such as requests, handlers, and responses. This improves separation of concerns and decouples components, making it easier to manage and scale.

Read-only Data with Dapper:
Dapper is used for read-only data queries to improve performance by reducing the overhead associated with Entity Framework Core for simple select queries.

Unit of Work:
The Unit of Work pattern is used to manage database transactions, ensuring that all changes to the data are handled consistently and are committed in a single operation.


Database Abstraction for Future Migrations:
The current implementation uses SQL Server, but it’s essential to abstract database interactions via the Repository Pattern and Database Provider interface to easily migrate to another database system in the future.

Integrate Testing & CI/CD:
Expand unit tests for critical features and implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes, ensuring high code quality and smoother release cycles.

Monitoring & Logging:
Implement structured logging in Elasticsearch to facilitate real-time monitoring, crash reporting, and traceability.
